## Overview
This project involved a full-scale migration of CRM data from Salesforce to Zoho CRM. The goal was to ensure a seamless transition with zero data loss, minimal downtime, and long-term maintainability for future data associations.

Salesforce remained the active system during the initial migration to allow business operations to continue uninterrupted.

## Objectives
- Export all relevant Salesforce data for migration
- Clean and transform data to ensure compatibility with Zoho CRM
- Accurately map Salesforce fields to existing and custom Zoho fields
- Preserve Salesforce record IDs for future attachment and data associations
- Perform an initial import while Salesforce remained live

## Scope of Migration
The migration covered multiple core CRM modules with significant data volume:

- Leads: 14,313  
- Contacts: 5,979  
- Accounts: 4,162  
- Opportunities: 17,244  
- Products: 241  
- Tasks: 182,070  

## Implementation Details

### 1. Salesforce Data Export
All required Salesforce modules were exported in structured formats to support transformation, validation, and staged importing into Zoho CRM.

### 2. Data Cleaning and Transformation
Data was reviewed and prepared to ensure accuracy and compatibility:
- Removed duplicates and invalid records
- Normalized data formats such as dates and picklist values
- Ensured required fields met Zoho CRM validation rules

### 3. Field Mapping and Zoho Setup
- Mapped Salesforce fields to corresponding Zoho CRM fields
- Created custom fields in Zoho CRM where no direct equivalents existed
- Validated relationships between modules to maintain referential integrity

### 4. Record ID Preservation
Salesforce record IDs were stored within Zoho CRM records to:
- Simplify future attachment migration
- Maintain traceability between systems
- Support post-migration validation and reconciliation

### 5. Initial Data Import
The first full data import was performed while Salesforce remained the active CRM, allowing:
- Business operations to continue without disruption
- Data validation in Zoho CRM before final cutover
- Iterative adjustments based on import results

## Outcome
The migration successfully transferred over 220,000 records across multiple CRM modules while maintaining data accuracy, relationships, and system continuity. The structured approach ensured a smooth transition and laid the groundwork for future automation and system enhancements within Zoho CRM.
